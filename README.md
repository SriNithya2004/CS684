# CS684 - Embedded Systems (Spring 2024-25)

This repository contains my coursework for **CS684: Embedded Systems** at IIT Bombay, including lecture slides, assignment PDFs and solutions, lab questions and solutions, and project files.

## üìö Lecture Slides

Lecture slides covering topics such as model-based design, Lustre/Heptagon, synchronous programming, scheduling theory, and real-time systems.

Files:
- `1Introduction.pdf` to `14SchedulingTheory2_priorityinversion.pdf`

## üìù Assignments

All assignments are available as question PDFs and my solutions as `.tar.gz` archives.

| Assignment | Question PDF | Solution Archive |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Assignment 1 | `cs684_Ass1.pdf` | `210050152_Assignment_1.tar.gz` |
| Assignment 2 | `cs684_Ass2.pdf` | `210050152_assignment2.tar.gz` |
| Assignment 3 | `cs684_Ass3.pdf` | `210050152_assignment3.tar.gz` |

## üî¨ Labs (Bot on Wheels Project)

These labs were part of a group project focused on robot line-following tasks using Lustre/Heptagon and Embedded C. Each lab includes a problem statement and our corresponding solution.

This work was done in collaboration with my teammates:
- **Srija** (210050098)  
- **Sohith** (210050116)  
- **Sai Kumar** (210050120)  
- **Sri Nithya** (210050152)

### üîó Overview

The course focused on:
- Embedded systems design using **model-based approaches** (FSMs, Statecharts, Lustre/Heptagon)
- Programming for cyber-physical systems
- Real-time scheduling theory and RTOS concepts
- Practical robot navigation and control using embedded code
